1. Let R be the set of positive real numbers and define addition, 
denoted by $\oplus$, and multiplication, denoted by $\otimes$, 
as follows. For every $a, b \in R$, $a \oplus b = ab$, and $a \otimes b
= a^{\log b}$. Please prove or disprove $(R, \oplus, \otimes)$.
\bigskip

axiom -1: since $R \in R^+$, $\oplus$ is closed in $R$. There is
no positive real number for which $a \dor b \in R^+$

axiom 0: since $R \in R^+$ and $\otimes$ is defined as $a \otimes b
= a^{\log b}$, starting with the lowest possible value, $a,b = 1$, $1^{log 1}$
results in 1, which is included in $R^+$. 
as both values approach infinity the result also approaches infinity
which is a real number.

axiom 1: addition is commutative, for all values $a,b$, $a \cdot b = b \cdot a$

axiom 2: addition is associative, for all values $a,b,c$, $(a \cdot b)\cdot c =
a \cdot (b \cdot c)$

axiom 3: there exists an additive identity. since the $\otimes$ is defined as 
$a \oplus b = ab$, the addtive identity is 1. $1 \cdot x = x \cdot 1 = x$.

axiom 4: There is an additive inverse. Since the additive identity is 1, there must
be a value for every $x \in R^+$ where $x \cdot y = 1$. This would be the inverse of
of the number $x$. For example: $x = 3$, $x \cdot x^{-1} = 3 \cdot 1/3 = 1$

axiom 5: multiplication is commutative. $a \otimes b i= a^{\log b}$. This is
commutative because if you take $log_a$ of both sides it resutls in 
$log b = log_a b^{log a}$. Breaking apart the right side,
$\frac{log a \cdot log b}{log a}$ in which both $log a$ cancel each other 
out and you're left with $log b = log b$. Since they are equal,
$\otimes$ is commutative.

axiom 6: Multiplication is associative. Given $a, b, c$: $(a \otimes b) \otimes
c = a \otimes (b \otimes c)$ on the left, the resultant is $(a ^{log b})^{log c}$, 
and on the right side, $(a ^{log b})^{log c}$. Since these are equal, multiplication
is associative

axiom 7: there exists a multiplicatave identity. This axiom holds true for the
value 10. $(a^{log 10} = 10 ^ {log a} = a)$

axiom 8: there exists a multiplicatave inverse. since the multiplicatave identity
is 10, the multiplicatave inverse will be a number where $a ^ {log b} = 10$
solving for be, $log b = log_a 10$, and solving for b, $b = 10^{log_a 10}$. 
Since $a \in R^+$, $log_a 10$ is positive for all values a. This means that
$10^{R^+}$ and will result in a positive real number meaning that for all 
values $a$, there exists another number $b\in R^+$ for the multiplicatave inverse.

axiom 9:

Since R contains only real positive numbers, both a and b are positive real numbers.
axiom 4 states that for any number there must be some element that when the addition
operator is applied, it results in 0. In range R, there cannot exist a number, b,
in R where $a \oplus b = 0$. Therefore $(R, \oplus, \otimes)$ is not a field
\bigskip
 
2. Denote the set {0,1,2,3} in $Z_4$ and define addition, denoted by +, and
multiplication, denoted by $\cdot$ or juxtapostion, via the following tables:
\bigskip
 
axiom 8 states that for every number in $Z_4$ there is a multiplicative inverse
where $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$. 2 from the range $Z_4$ has no multiplicatave inverse
because there exists no other number, b, in $Z_4$ where $a \cdot b = 1$. 
\bigskip

3. Suppose x is apositive integer with n digits, say $x = d_1 d_2 d_3 ... d_n$ in other
words, $d_i \in [0,1,2...,9]$ for $ 1 \leq i \leq n$, but $d_1 \neq 0$. Please prove or 
disprove the following. Recall that, for $a,b \in Z$, a is a divisor of b if $b = ak$,
for some $k \in Z$.

(a)If 9 is a divisor of $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + ... + d_n$, then 9 is a divisor of x.

Given that for $a,b \in Z$, a is a divisor of b if $b = ak$, for some $k \in Z$
the only time where 9 is a divisor of $d_1+d_2+d_3+...+d_n$ is when it is also a value
of $9*k$.


(b)If $d_n = 0$ or $d_n = 5$, then 5 is a divisor of x.

to begin consider all of the values in $x = d_1 d_2 d_3 ... d_n$ where $d_n = 0$. 
this can be re-written as $x = d_1(10^n) + d_2(10^{n-1}) + d_3(10^{n-2}) + ... + 
d_{n-1}(10^1)$ now we can factor out a 10 from the entire thing resulting in
$x = 10(d_1(10^{n-1}) + d_2(10^{n-2}) + d_3(10^{n-3}) + ... + d_{n-1})$. Since
the 10 is divisible by 5, for all values of $x$ where $d_n = 0$, it will be divisible
by 5. Now to consider when $d_n=5$ given that any number where $d_n = 0$ is divisible
by 5, let us consider the following $x = 10(d_1(10^{n-1}) + d_2(10^{n-2}) + d_3(10^{n-3}) 
+ ... + d_{n-1}) + 5$ now if we were to factor out a five from the equation, it would
resutl in $x = 5(2(d_1(10^{n-1}) + d_2(10^{n-2}) + d_3(10^{n-3}) + ... + d_{n-1})+1)$
which will be divisible by 5 as well. Thus all numbers where $d_n = 0,5$ are divisible 
5.
\bigskip

4. Please prove or disprove: if $n \in Z^+$, then $n^2+n+41$ is prime:

question 4 asserts that if $n \in Z^+$, then for all values $n$, $n^2+n+41$
will be prime. In order to disprove this, there must be some value for $n$
where the output isn't prime. take $n=40$, this results in $40^2+40+41=1681$.
$1681$ is not prime because $41$ is a factor of $1681$. Therefore $n^2+n+41$
is not prime for all $n \in Z^+$.
