1. Let R be the set of positive real numbers and define addition, 
denoted by $\oplus$, and multiplication, denoted by $\otimes$, 
as follows. For every $a, b \in R$, $a \oplus b = ab$, and $a \otimes b
 = a^{\log b}$. Please prove or disprove $(R, \oplus, \otimes)$.
 \bigskip
 
 Since R contains only real positive numbers, both a and b are positive real numbers.
 axiom 4 states that for any number there must be some element that when the addition
 operator is applied, it results in 0. In range R, there cannot exist a number, b,
 in R where $a \oplus b = 0$. Therefore $(R, \oplus, \otimes)$ is not a field
 \bigskip
 
 2. Denote the set {0,1,2,3} in $Z_4$ and define addition, denoted by +, and
 multiplication, denoted by $\cdot$ or juxtapostion, via the following tables:
 \bigskip
 
 axiom 8 states that for every number in $Z_4$ there is a multiplicative inverse
 where $a \cdot a^{-1} = 1$. 2 from the range $Z_4$ has no multiplicatave inverse
 because there exists no other number, b, in $Z_4$ where $a \cdot b = 1$.

3. Suppose x is apositive integer with n digits, say $x = d_1 d_2 d_3 ... d_n$ in other
words, $d_i \in [0,1,2...,9]$ for $ 1 \leq i \leq n$, but $d_1 \neq 0$. Please prove or 
disprove the following. Recall that, for $a,b \in Z$, a is a divisor of b if $b = ak$,
for some $k \in Z$.

(a)If 9 is a divisor of $d_1 + d_2 + d_3 + ... + d_n$, then 9 is a divisor of x.

Given that for $a,b \in Z$, a is a divisor of b if $b = ak$, for some $k \in Z$
the only time where 9 is a divisor of $d_1+d_2+d_3+...+d_n$ is when it is also a value
of $9*k$.


(b)If $d_n = 0$ or $d_n = 5$, then 5 is a divisor of x.

to begin consider all of the values in $x = d_1 d_2 d_3 ... d_n$ except $d_n$. 
this can be re-written as $x = d_1(10^n) + d_2(10^{n-1}) + d_3(10^{n-2}) + ... + 
d_{n-1}(10^1)$ now we can factor out a 10 from the entire thing resulting in
$x = 10(d_1(10^{n-1}) + d_2(10^{n-2}) + d_3(10^{n-3}) + ... + d_{n-1})$
\bigskip

4. Please prove or disprove: if $n \in Z^+$, then $n^2+n+41$ is prime:

question 4 asserts that if $n \in Z^+$, then for all values $n$, $n^2+n+41$
will be prime. In order to disprove this, there must be some value for $n$
where the output isn't prime. take $n=40$, this results in $40^2+40+41=1681$.
$1681$ is not prime because $41$ is a factor of $1681$. Therefore $n^2+n+41$
is not prime for all $n \in Z^+$.
