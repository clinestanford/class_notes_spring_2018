& | << >> 

logical operators:
&& || ! 
logical operators will short circuit(if 1st fills parameter skips others)


1. edit  .java
2. compile javac -> .class
3. load .class library .class
4. verify validate + security
5. interpret  converts to machine code

JDK-java development kit: language library, and include the compiler
	compiler is javac
	compiler is part of the JDK, if problems, it is with the JDK
	editing and compiling in java (steps 1-2)
	(command line) javac file.java //creates a .class file
	.class file is in bytecode (can be ran on different OS)

JRE-java runtime environment: java virtual machine, or VM
	allows us to run a java program
	if a java file can't be run, there is a problem with the JRE
	load verify interpret (steps 3-5)
	(command line) java file

java made it big because you can compile it once and run it anywhere
because of its bytecode property, and the emergence of the internet,
java became a big deal because of different OS and doing server side
things


java -cp ./src (file path to the text file)
