Squirmy Analysis:
Multi-Agent Systems
Stanford Cline

It was interesting to see the difference between the centrally controled worm and
the agent worm. The centrally controlled worm knew where the apple was throughout
the entire game, while the agent would wander randomly until it came within a 
certain distance of the apple, at which point it would "see" the apple and go straight
for it. At the beginning I would have anticipated the central worm to win almost every
time, and for a while it was winning every time because I hadn't correctly programmed 
the agent, but once I got all the kinks in the programming of the agent it was interesting
to see the two go. 

The central worm grow much faster when the apples spawned indefinitely, but would nearly
always die after being hit by the smaller agent. If the rules of the game were changed a
little bit to making the larger worm win, which to me seems logical, the central agent would 
most likely win every scenario, until it split and separated into two smaller worms. The 
central worm performed better in was when the apples were limited to just one quadrant of
the screen.

apart from the indefinite spawning of the apples and the single quadrant, the agent seemed
to outperform the central worm. It would grow at a more steady rate, and did better.

The way I tested for my data was by running each of the different simulations 15 times. The
results of these different tests are in the appledata.png file from the zip. 

It was an interesting assignment, and I liked that fact that I could learn for myself.

Thanks!
