design systems to act for groups of humans
with 'green' city, find the best ways to make a system better

What is an agent?
it is autonomous, acts independently and is a computer system 
capable of autonomous action in some evironment

persistant software dedicated to a specific purpose
-autonomy: operate without intervention from humans and have control over
	their actions and internal state
-social ability: agents interact with other agents via some kind of agent
-reactivity: agents perceive their environment and respond to changes
-pro-activeness: able to exhibit goal-directed behaviour by taking initiative

BDI (belief desires and intentions)
other properties of agents:
-mobility
-veracity
-benevolence
-rational

Uncertain Pair-wise preferences:
how to match pairs (husbands and wives so they get along) very difficult to
consider all of the information that is going to be going into the system,
and give them all their first choice

revolutions within the computer field:
	1. ubiquity, everyone has one
	2. interconnection, communitcation
	3. intelligence, accept the computers 'judgements'

interesting conundrum of car selling vs. the purchasing of the car
if the average price of the car is 5, even when the quality of the 
car justifies more, it is unlikely that a consumer would pay more than
the average when the quality isn't fully known. 
this is the case when only the seller knows the value of the car

Fields with inspired agents
	AI
	Software engineering

What are agents and why aren't they objects?
	agent can have multiple objects
	agents seem to be things that can come up with their own decisions
	-by giving objects/agents their agency, you are allowing them
	to make their own decisions

Why use agents?
	1. distributed environment, it is impossible to describe situation
	2. Former paradigms/thoughts aren't as relevant
	3. open systems (it is going to be hard to predict everything)
		-don't fully know the situation (extra variables)

Decentralization
	1. decisions made faster
	2. less infrastructure
	3. transparency

Motivations for Multi-agent systems:
	1. Solve problems too large for a centralized agent
	2. Allow interconnection and interoperations of multiple systems
	3. solution to inherentl distributed problems
	4. solutions that draw from distributed informations sources
	5. solutions where expertise are distributed
	6. conceptual clarity and simplicity of design
	7. to be able to hide strategies from competition

Benefits:
	1. faster problem solving
	2. decrease communication
	3. flexibility

*an agent is something that is capable of independent work/action on behalf
of its owner*
