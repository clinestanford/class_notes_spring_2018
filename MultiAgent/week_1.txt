design systems to act for groups of humans
with 'green' city, find the best ways to make a system better

What is an agent?
it is autonomous, acts independently and is a computer system 
capable of autonomous action in some evironment

persistant software dedicated to a specific purpose
-autonomy: operate without intervention from humans and have control over
	their actions and internal state
-social ability: agents interact with other agents via some kind of agent
-reactivity: agents perceive their environment and respond to changes
-pro-activeness: able to exhibit goal-directed behaviour by taking initiative

BDI (belief desires and intentions)
other properties of agents:
-mobility
-veracity
-benevolence
-rational

Uncertain Pair-wise preferences:
how to match pairs (husbands and wives so they get along) very difficult to
consider all of the information that is going to be going into the system,
and give them all their first choice

revolutions within the computer field:
	1. ubiquity, everyone has one
	2. interconnection, communitcation
	3. intelligence, accept the computers 'judgements'
