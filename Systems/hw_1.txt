1.1-
1 - computers in cars: today there are computers in car the automate several 
things in the car increasing safety and efficiency for the vehicle
2 - internet: it is hard to find anything that hasn't been revolutionized by 
the internet. All hosted and supported by computers
3 - search engines: need to find all of the necessary information on the web, 
and avoid a lot of the crap. search engines optimized this proccess.
4 - fitbit: there are now computers worn on the wrist to monitor several vitals 
of a person in order to tailor workouts and other programs for them

1.2-
assembly lines in automobile manufacturing = pipelining
suspension bridge cables = redundancy
aircraft and marine navigation systems = prediction
elevators = hierarchy of memories
library reserve desk = make the common case fast
increase gate area on CMOS = Design for Moore's Law
Adding electromagnetic aircraft catapults = parallelism
Building self-driving cars = use abstraction to simplify

1.3-
a program written in c is then converted into assembly which converts that 
directly into binary. The binary is then executed on the hardware

1.4- (8 bits is 1 Byte)
Assume a color display using 8-bits for each of the primary colors per pixel and a frame size of 1280x1024?

a. 1280x1024x(24 bits/8(bits/Byte)) = 3,932,160 Bytes
b. (1280x1024x24 bits)(1e-6 Mb/bit)/(100 Mb/s) = .314 s.
