tansistors are just switches. built on a silicon wafer

all software has to run on hardware, find out which is faster

depending on the cpu, it will be able to handle different things:
	MIPS: 130 instructions
	x86, x64: 1400 instructions
	ARM: 255 instructions

hard to determine fastest computer, depends on what your goal is

How much faster?? take the faster and divide by slower. Gives you 
the ratio

Latency: time from input to corresponding output

Throughput: Results produced per unit time

on the CPU it will first look at the cache to see if the necessary
software is there, then it will check the RAM and finally the hard-
drive. The more it checks, the longer it takes and the less efficient
it is.

seconds/program = cycles/program * seconds/cycle

there will be an average cycles per instruction("CPI")
	not all cycles will take the same amount of time

CPU time = Instruction Count * CPI * Clock Cycle Time
MIPS: millions of Instructions per Seconds

improve performance:
	decrease required cycles for a program
	decrease the clock cycle time
	increase the clock rate
	decrease the CPI (average clocks per instruction)
