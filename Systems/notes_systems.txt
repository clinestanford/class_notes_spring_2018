tansistors are just switches. built on a silicon wafer

all software has to run on hardware, find out which is faster

depending on the cpu, it will be able to handle different things:
	MIPS: 130 instructions
	x86, x64: 1400 instructions
	ARM: 255 instructions

hard to determine fastest computer, depends on what your goal is

How much faster?? take the faster and divide by slower. Gives you 
the ratio

Latency: time from input to corresponding output

Throughput: Results produced per unit time
