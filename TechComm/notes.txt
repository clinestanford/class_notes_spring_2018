Some of the climate change problems stems from a lack of communication
	-should use simple language, repeat and one other

there are a lot of negative effects of global warming
	-heat trapping CO2
	-military has a lot of concerns as well
	-could effect the economy as well

Several scientists want to cast doubt on the matter
	-typically would be funded by big businesses to do so
	-cast doubt on it by calling it a 'theory'

Global warming isn't getting the media coverage leftists think it should
	-by changing the words associated with climate change
	a real change will occur
